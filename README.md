# The Community of Researchers Assessing Chemical Transformations and Exploring Reactivity (CoReACTER)

The **Community of Researchers Assessing Chemical Transformations and Exploring Reactivity (CoReACTER)** is a research organization that operates within the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). We focus on leveraging developments in **computational chemistry, chemical data science, and high-throughput experimentation** to advance sustainable technologies in areas such as **energy storage, chemical manufacturing, and waste management**. Our [website](https://coreacter.org) contains more information about our [research efforts](https://coreacter.org/research/) and our [publications]([/publications/](https://coreacter.org/publications/)).

The CoReACTER is working hard to practice science in an **ethical, thoughtful, and anti-oppressive** fashion. This is an ongoing process, but you can read about our current thoughts and practices [here](https://coreacter.org/philosophy/principles/). Our [resources](https://coreacter.org/resources/) are mainly designed for [ReACTERs](https://coreacter.org/people/) and other folks currently working and conducting research at CMU, but you may also find these helpful!

# Land Acknowledgment

We acknowledge that CMU occupies the unceded lands of the Seneca (Haudenosaunee), Shawnee, and Lenape peoples, in what is now known as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States of America. We recognize that we benefit from this unjust occupation, the colonization of this region, and the concomitant displacement and elimination of Native peoples. We strive to enter into respectful relationships with the peoples of these lands and with the lands themselves as we search for avenues for healing, justice, and reconciliation.
